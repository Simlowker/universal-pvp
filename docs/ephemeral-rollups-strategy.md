## Component Classification

### 🚀 EPHEMERAL ROLLUP CANDIDATES (High Frequency, Temporary)

#### 1. PvP Battle Execution
- **Current Location**: `game-program/instructions/execute_action.rs`
- **Why**: High-frequency actions, temporary match state
- **Benefits**: 90% cost reduction, sub-second finality
- **Data**: Combat actions, turn management, temporary health/mana

#### 2. Match Sessions
- **Current Location**: `game-program/state.rs` (Match struct)
- **Why**: Temporary state, defined lifecycle
- **Benefits**: Isolated execution, automatic cleanup
- **Data**: Active match state, player turns, combat logs

#### 3. Tournament Brackets
- **Current Location**: Future tournament system
- **Why**: Event-based, temporary competition structure
- **Benefits**: Massive scale handling, cost efficiency
- **Data**: Bracket progression, temporary rankings

#### 4. Real-time Leaderboards
- **Current Location**: Aggregated from match results
- **Why**: Frequent updates, temporary rankings
- **Benefits**: Real-time updates without mainnet costs
- **Data**: Live tournament rankings, session statistics

### 🔒 MAINNET RETENTION (Permanent, High Value)

#### 1. Player Profile NFTs
- **Current Location**: `nft-program/` - PlayerNft struct
- **Why**: Permanent identity, cross-platform value
- **Rationale**: Long-term asset value, composability

#### 2. Achievement NFTs
- **Current Location**: `nft-program/` - AchievementNft struct
- **Why**: Permanent accomplishments, social status
- **Rationale**: Persistent recognition, marketplace value

#### 3. Token Economics
- **Current Location**: `token-program/` - Core token operations
- **Why**: Financial security, DeFi integration
- **Rationale**: Maximum security for financial assets

#### 4. Governance and Staking
- **Current Location**: `token-program/instructions/stake_tokens.rs`
- **Why**: Long-term commitments, voting rights
- **Rationale**: Requires maximum decentralization

### ⚖️ HYBRID CANDIDATES (Context-Dependent)

#### 1. Item NFTs (Equipment)
- **Temporary during battles** → Ephemeral Rollup
- **Permanent ownership** → Mainnet storage
- **Strategy**: Proxy system with rollup execution rights

#### 2. Reward Distribution
- **Calculation and processing** → Ephemeral Rollup
- **Final token minting** → Mainnet settlement
- **Strategy**: Batch processing with mainnet finalization
