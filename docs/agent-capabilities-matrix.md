## 🔧 Advanced Agent Features

### Memory Sharing
Agents can share context through the memory coordinator:
- Session persistence across agent spawns
- Knowledge transfer between agents
- State synchronization for distributed tasks

### Neural Learning
Some agents support neural pattern training:
- Pattern recognition from successful runs
- Adaptive behavior based on feedback
- Performance optimization through learning

### Fault Tolerance
Distributed agents include self-healing capabilities:
- Automatic retry on failure
- Graceful degradation
- Byzantine fault tolerance for critical systems

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core agents, add specialized ones as needed
2. **Batch Operations**: Always spawn related agents in a single message
3. **Use Appropriate Topology**: Match coordination pattern to project complexity
4. **Monitor Progress**: Use task-orchestrator for complex workflows
5. **Enable Learning**: Let agents train on successful patterns
6. **Document Decisions**: Use memory-coordinator for decision persistence

## 🛠️ Querying Agent Capabilities
