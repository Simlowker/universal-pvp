# ADR-002: Microservices Architecture for SOL Duel Backend

## Status
Accepted

## Context

SOL Duel requires a backend architecture that can handle:
- Real-time multiplayer game sessions with low latency
- High-volume concurrent user connections (target: 10,000+ DAU)
- Complex matchmaking algorithms and tournament management
- Integration with Solana blockchain for transactions and state
- Scalable reward distribution and NFT management
- Administrative functions and monitoring capabilities

We need an architecture that provides scalability, maintainability, fault tolerance, and allows independent deployment of components.

### Options Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - Single deployable unit containing all functionality
   - Simpler initial development and deployment
   - Shared database and runtime environment
   - Limited scalability and technology flexibility

2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Decomposed into independent, loosely-coupled services
   - Each service owns its data and business logic
   - Independent deployment and scaling capabilities
   - Technology diversity and team autonomy

3. **Modular Monolith**
   - Monolithic deployment with modular internal structure
   - Clear boundaries between modules
   - Shared database with logical separation
   - Migration path to microservices

## Decision

We will implement a **Microservices Architecture** for the SOL Duel backend system.

### Rationale

**Scalability Requirements**
- Different services have varying load patterns (game engine vs. user management)
- Independent horizontal scaling based on demand
- Resource optimization for each service's specific needs
- Better handling of traffic spikes during tournaments

**Technology Optimization**
- Game Engine: Node.js with Socket.io for real-time WebSocket communication
- Matchmaking: Python with machine learning libraries for advanced algorithms
- Blockchain Integration: Rust services for optimal Solana interaction
- API Gateway: TypeScript/Node.js for rapid development and ecosystem integration

**Development Team Structure**
- Allows specialized teams for different domains (game logic, blockchain, frontend)
- Independent development and deployment cycles
- Reduced coordination overhead between teams
- Easier onboarding with focused service ownership

**Fault Tolerance and Resilience**
- Isolation of failures to specific services
- Circuit breaker patterns for service-to-service communication
- Independent recovery and rollback capabilities
- Graceful degradation of non-critical features

## Service Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- **REST APIs**: Standard HTTP/JSON for request-response patterns
- **GraphQL**: For complex data fetching requirements (admin dashboard)
- **gRPC**: High-performance communication for latency-critical paths

### Asynchronous Communication
- **Message Queues**: Redis Pub/Sub for real-time event distribution
- **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka for event sourcing and audit trails
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication management

### Communication Matrix
```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Service         │ Communication Pattern                        │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ API Gateway     │ REST → All Services                          │
│ Game Engine     │ WebSocket ↔ Client, Events → Message Queue  │
│ Matchmaking     │ REST ↔ User Service, Events → Game Engine   │
│ Blockchain      │ gRPC ↔ Rewards, Events → All Services       │
│ Rewards         │ REST ↔ User Service, gRPC ↔ Blockchain      │
│ Tournament      │ REST ↔ Matchmaking, Events → Notification   │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Data Management Strategy

### Database Per Service Pattern
Each service owns its data and database schema:

```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ Service         │ Database         │ Data Types              │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ User Service    │ PostgreSQL       │ Profiles, Auth, Stats   │
│ Game Engine     │ Redis + MongoDB  │ Game State, Sessions    │
│ Matchmaking     │ Redis + PostgreSQL│ Queues, Match History  │
│ Tournament      │ PostgreSQL       │ Brackets, Registration  │
│ Rewards         │ PostgreSQL       │ Balances, Transactions  │
│ Blockchain      │ MongoDB + Redis  │ Accounts, Events       │
│ Analytics       │ ClickHouse       │ Metrics, Time Series   │
│ Notification    │ MongoDB          │ Messages, Preferences  │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

### Data Consistency Patterns
- **Eventual Consistency**: For non-critical cross-service data
- **Saga Pattern**: For distributed transactions (game completion → rewards)
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trails and game replay capability
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for performance optimization
