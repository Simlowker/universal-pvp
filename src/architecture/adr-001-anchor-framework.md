# ADR-001: Use Anchor Framework for Smart Contract Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context

SOL Duel requires robust smart contract development on Solana blockchain for managing game state, player profiles, tournaments, and reward distribution. We need to choose a framework that provides:

- Type safety and developer experience
- Security best practices and patterns  
- Efficient program deployment and upgrades
- Integration with existing Solana ecosystem
- Comprehensive testing capabilities

### Options Considered

1. **Native Solana Programs (Rust)**
   - Direct Solana program development using raw Rust
   - Maximum control and optimization potential
   - Requires significant boilerplate code
   - Higher complexity and error potential

2. **Anchor Framework**
   - High-level framework built on Solana programs
   - Automatic serialization/deserialization
   - Built-in security checks and validations
   - TypeScript client generation
   - Extensive ecosystem and community support

3. **Seahorse** 
   - Python-based framework for Solana programs
   - Easier learning curve for non-Rust developers
   - Less mature ecosystem
   - Potential performance limitations

## Decision

We will use **Anchor Framework** for all smart contract development in SOL Duel.

### Rationale

**Type Safety and Developer Experience**
- Anchor provides automatic generation of TypeScript/JavaScript clients
- Compile-time validation of account structures and constraints
- Clear error messages and debugging capabilities
- Extensive IDE support and tooling

**Security and Best Practices**
- Built-in security checks (overflow protection, account validation)
- Standardized patterns for common operations
- Automatic rent exemption calculations
- Protection against common Solana vulnerabilities

**Performance and Efficiency**
- Zero-copy deserialization reduces compute usage
- Efficient account layouts and space calculations
- Optimized instruction processing
- Support for program-derived addresses (PDAs)

**Ecosystem Integration**
- Compatible with all major Solana wallets
- Integration with popular tools (Metaplex, Clockwork, etc.)
- Extensive documentation and community resources
- Active development and maintenance

**Development Velocity**
- Significantly reduces boilerplate code
- Automatic client SDK generation
- Built-in testing framework with test utilities
- Hot reloading and development tools

## Implementation Details

### Project Structure
```
programs/
├── sol-duel-game/          # Core game mechanics
├── sol-duel-tournament/    # Tournament management  
├── sol-duel-rewards/       # Reward distribution
├── sol-duel-nft/          # NFT profile system
└── sol-duel-governance/    # DAO governance
```

### Key Features Utilized
- **Account Constraints**: Automatic validation of account relationships
- **Error Handling**: Custom error codes with descriptive messages  
- **Events**: Emit events for off-chain indexing and monitoring
- **Seeds and Bumps**: Deterministic PDA generation
- **State Management**: Efficient account layouts and upgrades

### Example Implementation
```rust
#[program]
pub mod sol_duel_game {
    use super::*;
    
    pub fn initialize_game(
        ctx: Context<InitializeGame>,
        game_id: u64,
        wager_amount: u64,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        let game_state = &mut ctx.accounts.game_state;
        
        game_state.game_id = game_id;
        game_state.player1 = ctx.accounts.player1.key();
        game_state.wager_amount = wager_amount;
        game_state.status = GameStatus::WaitingForPlayer;
        game_state.created_at = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
        
        emit!(GameCreated {
            game_id,
            player1: game_state.player1,
            wager_amount,
        });
        
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(game_id: u64)]
pub struct InitializeGame<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = player1,
        space = GameState::LEN,
        seeds = [b"game", game_id.to_le_bytes().as_ref()],
        bump
    )]
    pub game_state: Account<'info, GameState>,
    
    #[account(mut)]
    pub player1: Signer<'info>,
    
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Development**: Reduced development time with less boilerplate
- **Fewer Bugs**: Built-in validations prevent common errors
- **Better Testing**: Comprehensive test utilities and mocking capabilities
- **Easier Maintenance**: Clear code structure and automatic client generation
- **Community Support**: Large ecosystem and active community

### Negative
- **Framework Dependency**: Tied to Anchor framework lifecycle and updates
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Anchor-specific patterns and conventions
- **Abstraction Overhead**: Some low-level optimizations may be hidden
- **Version Compatibility**: Must manage Anchor version updates carefully

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Stay Current**: Regularly update to stable Anchor versions
- **Team Training**: Invest in Anchor framework training for development team
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor program performance and optimize when needed
- **Fallback Plan**: Maintain knowledge of native Solana development for critical optimizations

## Alternatives Considered

### Native Rust Programs
- **Pros**: Maximum control, no framework dependency, potential performance gains
- **Cons**: Significant development overhead, higher error probability, maintenance burden
- **Decision**: Rejected due to development velocity requirements

### Seahorse Framework  
- **Pros**: Python familiarity, easier learning curve
- **Cons**: Less mature, potential performance limitations, smaller ecosystem
- **Decision**: Rejected due to maturity and performance concerns

## Success Metrics
- Development velocity: 40% faster smart contract development compared to native Rust
- Bug reduction: 60% fewer critical vulnerabilities compared to native development
- Team productivity: Developers productive within 2 weeks of Anchor adoption
- Code quality: Consistent code patterns and reduced technical debt
