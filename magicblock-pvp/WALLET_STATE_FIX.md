# Wallet State Synchronization Fix

## Issue Description
Your wallet connects successfully but the UI doesn't update to show you're connected - it keeps showing "Connect Wallet" button.

## Root Cause
The wallet state isn't properly synchronizing between the Solana wallet adapter and the app's context/UI components.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced State Management**
Modified `WalletButton.tsx` to check both adapter and context state:
```typescript
// Now checking both states
const isConnected = connected && walletContext.wallet.connected;
```

### 2. **Added Debug Logging**
Added console logs to track connection state changes:
- Check browser console (F12) for state updates
- Look for "WalletButton state" and "WalletContext state change" logs

### 3. **Manual Refresh Button**
Added a yellow "ðŸ”„ Refresh Wallet State" button that appears after connection
- Click this to manually force refresh wallet data
- Updates balance and connection state

### 4. **Auto-Refresh on Connection**
Added automatic data refresh when wallet connects:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (connected && publicKey) {
    walletContext.refreshData();
  }
}, [connected, publicKey]);
```

## How to Use the Fix

### Option 1: Use Manual Wallet Buttons
1. Below "Connect Wallet", click the "Phantom" or "Solflare" button directly
2. This bypasses the modal and connects directly
3. After connecting, click "ðŸ”„ Refresh Wallet State" if needed

### Option 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for these logs when connecting:
   ```
   WalletContext state change: { connected: true, publicKey: "..." }
   Wallet connected, refreshing data...
   Fetching balance for: [your-address]
   Balance fetched: X.XX SOL
   ```

### Option 3: Force Refresh
After your wallet shows as connected in Phantom:
1. Click the yellow "ðŸ”„ Refresh Wallet State" button
2. This forces the app to re-check connection status
3. Your wallet address and balance should appear

## What to Check in Browser Console

After connecting, you should see:
```javascript
// Good signs:
WalletButton state: {
  adapterConnected: true,
  contextConnected: true,
  publicKey: "Your-Wallet-Address",
  balance: 0.123
}

// If you see this, connection worked:
"Wallet connected, refreshing data..."
"Balance fetched: X.XX SOL"
```

## If Still Not Working

### 1. Check Phantom Status
- Open Phantom extension
- Make sure it shows "Connected to localhost:3001"
- Ensure you're on Devnet network

### 2. Try Hard Refresh
```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Clear Next.js cache
cd "/Users/simeonfluck/universal pvp/magicblock-pvp/apps/web"
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### 3. Manual State Check
1. Open browser console
2. After connecting, type:
   ```javascript
   // Check if Phantom sees connection
   window.solana.isConnected
   // Should return: true
   ```

### 4. Use the Refresh Button
The yellow "ðŸ”„ Refresh Wallet State" button is your friend:
- Click it after connecting
- Click it if balance shows 0
- Click it if UI doesn't update

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `/apps/web/components/wallet/WalletButton.tsx`
  - Added state synchronization logic
  - Added manual refresh button
  - Enhanced connection handling

- `/apps/web/contexts/WalletContext.tsx`
  - Added debug logging
  - Improved state updates
  - Better error handling

- `/apps/web/app/providers.tsx`
  - Added wallet initialization logging
  - Debug output for troubleshooting

## Current Workaround

Until the auto-sync is perfect, use this workflow:

1. Click "Connect Wallet" or "Phantom" button
2. Approve in Phantom popup
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. If UI doesn't update, click "ðŸ”„ Refresh Wallet State"
5. Your wallet should now show connected with balance

## Next Steps

The app should now:
- Show manual wallet buttons (Phantom/Solflare)
- Display refresh button after connection
- Log detailed connection info to console
- Eventually show your wallet address and SOL balance

Remember: The yellow refresh button is there specifically to force update the state when needed!
