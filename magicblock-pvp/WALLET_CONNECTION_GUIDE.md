# Wallet Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## üîß Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer console (F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console) and look for any error messages when you click "Connect Wallet".

### 2. Install a Solana Wallet Extension

You need at least one of these wallet extensions installed in your browser:

#### **Phantom Wallet** (Recommended)

- Switch to Devnet network

### 3. Get Free Devnet SOL (Test Tokens)

Once connected, you'll need test SOL to play:

1. Copy your wallet address (click the address in Phantom to copy)
2. Go to: https://faucet.solana.com/
3. Paste your address and click "Devnet"
4. You'll receive 2 SOL for testing

### 4. Refresh and Try Again

1. Refresh the page (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. You should now see a wallet selection modal
4. Select your installed wallet (Phantom or Solflare)
5. Approve the connection in the wallet popup
