# Wallet Connection Fix Documentation

## Problem
User has Phantom wallet extension installed but clicking "Connect Wallet" doesn't work.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Debug Logging
- Added console.log statements to track wallet connection flow
- Logs show when button is clicked and if modal opens
- Added logging for available wallets and Phantom detection

### 2. Enhanced WalletButton Component
```typescript
// Added fallback connection methods:
- Direct Phantom connection if modal fails
- Manual wallet selection buttons for debugging
- Auto-detection of installed wallets
- Warning messages if no wallet is detected
```

### 3. Fixed Provider Configuration
- Added debug logging to track wallet adapter initialization
- Added useEffect to check if Phantom is available in window object
- Added TypeScript definitions for window.solana

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Right-click on the page → Inspect → Console tab
2. Keep console open while testing

### Step 2: Refresh the Page
```bash
# Hard refresh to clear cache
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Step 3: Check Console for Debug Info
You should see:
- "Wallet adapters initialized: ['Phantom', 'Solflare']"
- "Providers mounted"
- "Network: https://api.devnet.solana.com"
- "Window.solana available: true" (if Phantom is installed)
- "Window.solana.isPhantom: true" (if Phantom is detected)

### Step 4: Try Connection Methods

#### Method 1: Main Connect Button
1. Click "Connect Wallet" button
2. Check console for:
   - "Connect wallet clicked"
   - "Opening wallet modal..."
3. If modal doesn't appear, wait 2 seconds for fallback

#### Method 2: Manual Connection Buttons
Below the main button, you'll see manual buttons:
- Click "Phantom" button directly
- This bypasses the modal and connects directly

### Step 5: If Still Not Working

1. **Check Phantom Settings:**
   - Open Phantom extension
   - Click gear icon → Developer Settings
   - Enable "Testnet Mode"
   - Select "Devnet" network

2. **Allow Site Connection:**
   - Click Phantom extension icon
   - Check if localhost:3001 is in connected sites
   - If not, click "Connect" when prompted

3. **Clear Browser Data:**
   ```bash
   # Clear site data for localhost
   Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
   ```

4. **Try Different Browser:**
   - Chrome/Brave work best
   - Firefox sometimes has issues with extensions

## What Changed

### `/apps/web/components/wallet/WalletButton.tsx`
- Added fallback connection logic
- Added manual wallet selection buttons
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Added Phantom detection

### `/apps/web/app/providers.tsx`
- Added debug logging for wallet initialization
- Added useEffect to check wallet availability
- Better error tracking

### `/apps/web/types/window.d.ts` (New File)
- Added TypeScript types for window.solana
- Prevents TypeScript errors when accessing Phantom

## Current Status

The wallet connection now has multiple fallback methods:
1. Standard wallet modal (primary method)
2. Direct Phantom connection after 2s delay (automatic fallback)
3. Manual wallet selection buttons (manual fallback)
4. Error messages with installation links if no wallet detected

## Next Steps if Still Having Issues

1. **Check Browser Console** for any error messages
2. **Ensure Phantom is on Devnet** network
3. **Try the manual "Phantom" button** below Connect Wallet
4. **Report console errors** for further debugging

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Phantom extension installed
- [ ] Phantom set to Devnet
- [ ] Clicked "Connect Wallet"

## Success Indicators

When working correctly:
1. Clicking "Connect Wallet" opens wallet selection modal

3. Approving in Phantom connects wallet
4. Wallet address and balance appear in header
